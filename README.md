# SpaceTime
Just a really simple spacetime visualization that I wanted to make after seeing a YouTube video and thinking "I could do that better".

## What will it be?
Well, hopefully it will be a simple visualization of the fabric of spacetime as a little net underneath planets. I always thought that they looked cool and that I could probably make one. So here I am.

## What progress has been made?
Well, so far I have managed to get a planet to orbit around a central body. It is also completely scalable \(if your computer can handle it\) so you can get as many planets as you would like. 
In the future though, I have some ideas I would love to get done:
- [ ] Have a demo of the solar system
- [ ] Add in the fabric of spacetime
